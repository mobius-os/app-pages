# Building pages (the Pages app)

A page is a single self-contained HTML file — interactive (a chart,
calculator, small game, animated explainer), a design mockup (a proposed UI, a
flow diagram, an interactive explainer of a tradeoff), or a polished document (a
report, write-up, brief, or code explanation) — that the partner can open,
version, and share from the Pages app. You build the page; the Pages app is its
gallery: it shows which chat each page came from, its version history, a live
preview, and a public share button. This file is the source of truth for how
pages are stored and linked. Read this before building anything you would call
a canvas, visualization, mockup, report, or shareable page — and before
iterating on one that already exists.

Naming: the Pages app's storage tree and ids still use the word `artifact`
(`artifacts/<artifact_id>.json`, `intent=artifact:<id>`). That is durable
storage identity, not product vocabulary. In the partner's words a Pages item is
a **page**; an **artifact** is a Project's build output (a compiled PDF, a
built website) and lives with its Project, not here.

## Page or mini-app?

Reach for a page when the thing is **significant and self-contained** —
substantial enough to stand on its own (a rule of thumb: more than a dozen
lines, not a one-liner you'd just put in the chat).

| Build a PAGE when… | Build a MINI-APP when… |
|---|---|
| It is a self-contained page to look at, play with, read, or share — a viz, mockup, UI design, diagram, report, calculator, infographic, small game, document | It is a durable tool the partner returns to, with saved records and its own data model |
| It needs no storage or only small public-readable shared JSON; no embedded chat or cron — the page IS the product | It needs private records, `window.mobius` APIs, notifications, schedules, or registration |
| A logged-out person you share it with should be able to use it | It only makes sense inside Möbius |

When genuinely unsure, name both options in your clarifying turn and let the
partner pick. A page is much cheaper — prefer it for one-shot interactive
content and for standalone documents. When the partner is working inside a
Project (a `$PROJECT_ROOT` is set), build the Project's artifact instead — see
the project skill for that Project type.

## Suggest before building

A page can be the best feedback surface without being the best *first*
action. When a choice is primarily visual, spatial, or comparative and seeing
options would materially improve the partner's answer, offer a concrete
clarifying-question option such as **Create a visual comparison
(Recommended)**. Include concise non-page alternatives when they remain
reasonable. Do not create the page unless the partner chooses that option
or explicitly requests one.

Good moments to suggest one include choosing between interface directions,
comparing layouts or information hierarchy, reacting to a flow diagram, or
reviewing a dense visual report. Skip the suggestion for small copy choices,
straightforward defaults, and nonvisual decisions that are clearer in chat.

## Persisting data (optional)

Stay stateless by default. When a shared page genuinely needs owner-set
state—such as configuration, a counter, leaderboard, or dashboard data—use the
injected `window.mobiusArtifact.storage` API. It is shared per page, carries
across versions, and works automatically in previews and public shares; never
handle a share token yourself.

```js
const store = window.mobiusArtifact.storage
try {
  const value = await store.get('score')       // JSON value, or null
  await store.set('score', { total: 12 })      // current editor preview only
  await store.remove('score')                  // current editor preview only
  const keys = await store.list()              // string[]
} catch (error) {
  // Degrade gracefully: network, quota, and read-only failures are expected.
}
```

Check `store.writable` before showing write controls. `store.mode` is `editor`
in preview and `public-readonly` in a shared page; historical previews are also
read-only. Public viewers can read the shared data, so never store secrets, PII,
or private source material. Values must be JSON; keys match
`[a-z0-9._-]{1,64}`, each value is at most 64 KB, and the server caps a
page at 1 MB and 100 stored keys. `list()` is answered by the server from
what is actually stored, so it never drifts from `set()`/`remove()`. `set()` and `remove()` reject when writes
are unavailable—they never pretend to save.

---

## Where pages live

Pages are files in the **Pages app's storage tree**:
`/data/apps/<PAGES_APP_ID>/` where `PAGES_APP_ID` is the app's
**numeric id**. The installed app slug is `pages`; `artifacts` remains only the
upstream catalog manifest id and the durable record/intent vocabulary. Resolve
the numeric id fresh every time — it changes if the app is ever
reinstalled, so never hardcode it:

```bash
PAGES_APP_ID=$(curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  "$API_BASE_URL/api/apps/" | python3 -c \
  "import sys,json; print(next((a['id'] for a in json.load(sys.stdin) if a.get('slug')=='pages'),''))")
```

If it comes back empty, the Pages app is not installed — tell the partner
to install it from the App Store, and offer to build the page as a plain
mini-app instead. **Do not confuse the storage tree with
`/data/apps/pages/`** — that slug-named directory is the viewer app's source
code; never write page records there.

Inside the storage tree, an ordinary page uses two paths. A format skill
may additionally preserve editable inputs under the optional third path:

```
artifacts/<artifact_id>.json      # the record — metadata + version index
versions/<artifact_id>/v<N>.html  # one immutable file per version
sources/<artifact_id>/...         # durable builder source, optionally managed by Projects
```

Keep `sources/` absent for an ordinary self-contained page. Use it only
when the Web Studio or LaTeX builder skill owns a durable editable source tree.
Only these explicitly attributed builder outputs are eligible for **Add to
Projects**; ordinary mockups, diagrams, and reports are not. Do not infer a
builder from a title, extension, or the HTML preview. The record includes:

```json
{
  "project_import": {
    "template_id": "latex:document",
    "files": [
      {"storage_path": "sources/<artifact_id>/main.tex", "path": "main.tex"}
    ]
  }
}
```

`template_id` is `latex:document` or `webstudio:website` and must name an
installed Project template. Each `storage_path` is exactly
`sources/<artifact_id>/<path>` relative to the numeric Pages storage root.
List real editable source inputs needed to rebuild, never generated output,
private data, symlinks, or unrelated files. Write source inputs before
atomically publishing the record.

**Add to Projects manages the existing source tree; it never creates a second
editable copy.** The source directory remains the same before and after adding
it. Later edits use that source and publish a new build/preview; existing Page
versions are immutable snapshots and must not be rewritten. Preserve
`project_import` when iterating, updating its file list to match deliberate
source changes. Never detach or relocate a managed source tree while editing.
A builder output already managed by a Project is not offered again. In Pages,
use the page card's actions button, right-click, or long-press to choose
**Add to Projects** when eligible. Do not
retroactively label an old page without verifying its builder and complete
editable source. Collaboration via an agent need not require a Project;
Projects adds the source, Git, and collaborator management interface.

A page can also carry an optional `related_apps` array when it is
specifically about an existing Möbius app — for example, a redesign mockup,
flow diagram, or report for that app. Each entry uses the app row's real
identity: `{"id": 39, "slug": "app-store", "name": "App Store"}`. This is
separate from `chat_id` provenance: the page remains linked to the chat
that created each version, while also appearing among the work in the related
app's current maintaining chat.

Use `related_apps` only for an explicit relationship you can establish from
the current linked-app context or the live apps list. Include `id`, `slug`, and
`name` when available. The slug is the durable identity across installations;
the numeric id is only a fallback for older slug-less relationships. Never
infer a relationship from a similar title.
When iterating a page, preserve its existing relationships rather than
replacing them with whatever apps happen to be linked to the current chat.

**Never touch `shares/` or `projects/`** — those are the app's own bookkeeping
for public sharing. Sharing is the partner's action, taken in the app.

## Create a page

1. Author the page (rules below) and save it to a temp file.
2. Mint the id: slugified title + 4 random hex, all `[a-z0-9-]`, ≤ 45 chars
   total — e.g. `"Tip Calculator"` → `tip-calculator-7f3a`.
3. Write the version blob, then the record. Pass every value through
   **argv** (never interpolate a title/description into the Python source — a
   `"` or `$(...)` in it would break or inject), use a **quoted** heredoc, and
   write the record **atomically** (unique temp + `os.replace`) so the live
   gallery never reads a half-written file. Create the blob with `noclobber`
   so a rare id collision can never overwrite an existing page:

```bash
AID="tip-calculator-$(openssl rand -hex 2)"
D="/data/apps/$PAGES_APP_ID"
NOW=$(date -u +%FT%TZ)
TITLE="Tip Calculator"
DESC="Split a bill and compute per-person tips."
# If this page is explicitly about an existing app, copy its real identity
# from linked-app context; otherwise keep this as an empty JSON array.
RELATED_APPS_JSON='[]'

mkdir -p "$D/versions/$AID" "$D/artifacts"
# exclusive create — noclobber makes `>` fail instead of overwriting; a
# collision means mint a fresh id and retry rather than clobber someone's work.
if ! (set -o noclobber; cat page.html > "$D/versions/$AID/v1.html") 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "v1 already exists for $AID — mint a new id and retry"; exit 1
fi

python3 - "$D/artifacts/$AID.json" "$AID" "$TITLE" "$DESC" "$CHAT_ID" "$NOW" \
         "$D/versions/$AID/v1.html" "$RELATED_APPS_JSON" <<'PY'
import json, os, sys
path, aid, title, desc, chat, now, blob, related_json = sys.argv[1:9]
related = json.loads(related_json)
rec = {"id": aid, "title": title, "description": desc,
       "chat_id": chat,                      # provenance — the app links back here
       "created_at": now, "updated_at": now, "current_version": 1,
       "versions": [{"v": 1, "created_at": now, "chat_id": chat,
                     "note": "first version", "bytes": os.path.getsize(blob)}]}
if related:
    rec["related_apps"] = related             # semantic target — its app chat also shows it
tmp = f"{path}.{os.getpid()}.tmp"            # unique temp — concurrent writers don't collide
with open(tmp, "w") as f: json.dump(rec, f)
os.replace(tmp, path)                        # atomic swap — no torn reads
PY
```

Stamp `$CHAT_ID` exactly as shown — it is how the partner gets the
"open the chat this came from" link. If you prefer HTTP, the equivalent is
`PUT $API_BASE_URL/api/storage/apps/$PAGES_APP_ID/<path>` with
`Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN` (`.html` → `Content-Type: text/html` raw body; `.json` →
`application/json`, the body IS the document, no envelope). The HTTP PUT path
writes atomically on the server and enforces the storage quota, so it is the
safer choice for large pages.

## Iterate an existing page

Find the id first: it is in your earlier reply's link, or list
`$D/artifacts/` and match by title or `chat_id`. Then:

1. **Reuse the same `artifact_id`** — a new id would create a second page
   instead of a new version.
2. **Never overwrite an existing `v<N>.html`** — history is immutable. Write
   the next free version number, and refuse to clobber if it already exists
   (a concurrent turn may have taken it):

```bash
REC="$D/artifacts/$AID.json"
NEXT=$(python3 -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$REC'))['current_version']+1)")
DEST="$D/versions/$AID/v$NEXT.html"
NOTE="dark theme + rounding"
# exclusive create — if a concurrent turn already took v$NEXT, `>` fails here
# (no torn overwrite of immutable history); re-read the record and retry.
if ! (set -o noclobber; cat page.html > "$DEST") 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "v$NEXT already exists — re-read the record and retry with the next number"; exit 1
fi
python3 - "$REC" "$DEST" "$NEXT" "$NOTE" "$CHAT_ID" <<'PY'
import json, os, sys, datetime
rec, blob, nxt, note, chat = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], int(sys.argv[3]), sys.argv[4], sys.argv[5]
d = json.load(open(rec))                     # re-read fresh, then append
now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC).strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
d["current_version"] = nxt; d["updated_at"] = now
d["versions"].append({"v": nxt, "created_at": now, "chat_id": chat,
                      "note": note, "bytes": os.path.getsize(blob)})
tmp = f"{rec}.{os.getpid()}.tmp"; json.dump(d, open(tmp, "w")); os.replace(tmp, rec)
PY
```

3. Read the record fresh before appending (a different chat may have added a
   version) and bump `current_version` + `updated_at`.

If the partner shared the page publicly, the shared copy keeps showing the
version it was shared at — tell them they can update the shared version from
the app's Share sheet.

## Authoring rules — what makes a good page

- **One file, everything inline.** All CSS in `<style>`, all JS in inline
  `<script>`, images as inline SVG or `data:` URIs. **No CDNs, no webfonts, no
  remote `<script src>`** — the preview runs in a sandbox and shared pages must
  work anywhere; an external request is a broken page.
- **Mobile-first.** `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`,
  fluid layout, tap targets ≥ 44px. The partner opens these on a phone.
- **Design both themes** with `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` — unless
  the piece deliberately commits to one visual world (a neon game can stay
  dark). Keep contrast legible in both.
- **Calibrate the treatment.** A data report wants clean typography and quiet
  color; a game or showpiece earns a scene. Don't over-design utility pages,
  don't under-design the centerpiece. Real content throughout — never lorem.
- **Robust.** Wrap risky JS in try/catch and render a visible fallback message;
  a crashed page must not be blank.
- **Lean.** Keep the file well under 50 MB (large `data:` assets count) — the
  storage tree is capped at 1 GB; prefer SVG and generated canvas over big
  base64 blobs.
- **Title it like a product** ("Berlin Marathon Pacing", not "chart-v2") and
  give the record a one-line description — both show in the gallery.

### Documents and reports

A report, brief, write-up, or code explanation is a first-class page.
Render it as **semantic, self-contained HTML** — `<article>`, real headings,
paragraphs, lists, tables, links, and `<pre><code>` for code — with readable
typography and selectable text. Don't invent interactivity a document doesn't
need. Storage stays `.html` like any other page.

### Diagrams

Pre-render diagrams and flowcharts as accessible inline `<svg>` with a `<title>`
and `<desc>`. Do not emit raw Mermaid source and do not load Mermaid or any
diagram library from a CDN — the sandbox blocks it and a shared page must work
offline.

---

## Link it back in the chat

End your reply with the page link — the shell opens it in place:

```
[Open "Tip Calculator" →](/shell/?app=pages&intent=artifact:<artifact_id>)
```

Also send the durable notification so the partner can tap in later:

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST "$API_BASE_URL/api/notifications/send" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Page ready", "body": "Tip Calculator is ready to open and share.",
       "source_id": "'"$CHAT_ID"'",
       "target": "/shell/?app=pages&intent=artifact:'"$AID"'"}'
```

---

## Before you hand back

| If this turn… | Do before finishing |
|---|---|
| Built a page | Verify both files exist and the record parses (`python3 -m json.tool`); reply in partner language (what it does, not how it's stored); end with the Open link; send the notification. |
| Iterated one | Confirm `current_version` bumped and the new `v<N>.html` exists; say what changed; re-link it. If it was shared, mention the Share sheet can update the public version. |
| Hit a gotcha | Log it the usual way so future-you avoids it. |

Sharing, version browsing, downloading, deletion, and importing into Projects
are the partner's actions inside the Pages app and Projects — point them there
rather than doing it for them.
