# Pages

Pages is the Möbius catalog for self-contained pages — interactive mockups, visualizations, explainers, and polished documents — created by the in-product agent. The installed app slug is `pages`; its upstream catalog manifest id, record paths, and intent payload keep the historical word `artifacts`. A Project's build output is the thing Möbius calls an artifact. Pages gives owners one place to browse their pages, preview or inspect each version, copy or download its HTML, return to the originating chat, and publish a stable public snapshot.

Pages ships an always-on prompt fragment that nudges the agent to offer visuals when they would help.

## What it does

- Polls the app storage catalog while visible and reflects agent-created records without a reload.
- Runs self-contained HTML in an opaque nested iframe with scripts and popups, but no same-origin access.
- Shows immutable version history and lets the owner preview or inspect syntax-coloured, read-only source for any recorded version.
- Copies selected-version HTML as plain text and downloads it with an explicit scripts warning.
- Resolves origin chat titles through the redacted chat-log summary permission.
- Stages a selected version through Möbius publishing, tracks its stable public URL, updates it on demand, and unpublishes it.
- Injects an optional per-artifact JSON storage API: owners can write from the current preview, while public shares can read the same capped data without receiving app credentials.
- Handles `/shell/?app=pages&intent=artifact:<id>` intents and provides chat handoffs in both directions.

Version 0.5.0 adds owner-write/public-read artifact persistence. Stored version
files remain immutable; the app injects the appropriate preview or published
storage shim only when rendering or staging a copy.

## Storage contract

```text
artifacts/<artifact_id>.json
versions/<artifact_id>/v<N>.html
shares/<artifact_id>.json
projects/<artifact_id>/build/site/index.html
```

Artifact records and version files are agent-owned. Share records and publish staging are app-owned, so no file has competing writers.

## Development

The app is a source-only Möbius mini-app. `index.jsx` is the composition entry, `domain.js` contains pure record/version/share logic, `storage.js` owns runtime and HTTP integration, `theme.js` contains the scoped `af-` stylesheet, and feature UI lives under `ui/` and `preview/`.

Run the unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

The platform bundles `index.jsx` with Rolldown as one ESM module and supplies React and `date-fns` through the Möbius import map.
